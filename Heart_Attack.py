st.write("""**ðŸ‘ˆA heart attack, also known as a myocardial infarction (MI), occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle, leading to damage or death of heart cells due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention and treatment. Heart attacks can vary in severity, from mild to severe, and can be life-threatening.**. 

Causes:
Heart attacks are usually caused by the buildup of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances (collectively known as plaque) on the walls of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. When a plaque ruptures or a blood clot forms, it can block the artery and reduce or stop blood flowÂ toÂ theÂ heart.

Symptoms of a heart attack typically include chest pain or discomfort, characterized by a sensation of pressure, tightness, heaviness, or squeezing in the chest. The pain may radiate to the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach. Shortness of breath, cold sweat, and feelings of nausea or vomiting may also be present. Some individuals may experience atypical symptoms, particularly women, older adults, and those with diabetes. It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur, as a heart attack is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to restore blood flow to the heart and prevent further damage or potential life-threateningÂ complications.
