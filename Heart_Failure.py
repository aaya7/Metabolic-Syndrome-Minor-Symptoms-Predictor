st.write("""**ðŸ‘ˆHeart failure is a serious medical condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to insufficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to the body's tissues. It often develops gradually, and common symptoms include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs, and persistent coughing. Heart failure can result from various factors, such as coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, or damage to the heart muscles. It affects people of all ages but is more prevalent in older adults. Treatment involves lifestyle changes, medications, and, in some cases, surgery or medical devices to improve heart function and manage symptoms. Early detection and management are crucial to enhance quality of life and reduce complications.**. 

The causes of heart failure can be diverse and may include conditions that damage or strain the heart, such as coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, heart attacks, or heart valve problems. Other factors like diabetes, obesity, and certain medications can also contribute to its development. Prevention involves adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet low in salt and saturated fats, managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and seeking early medical attention for any heart-related symptoms. Early detection and proactive management of risk factors can significantly reduce the risk of heart failure and promote overall cardiovascularÂ health.
