st.write("""**üëàObesity is a chronic and complex medical condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat that poses a significant health risk. It is a prevalent global health issue and is associated with numerous adverse effects on physical, emotional, and social well-being. The condition arises from a combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors, with an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure being a primary contributor. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity based on a person's body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing an individual's weight (in kilograms) by the square of their height (in meters). A BMI of 30 or above is considered obese, while a BMI between 25 and 29.9 indicates overweight**. 

Obesity can lead to a range of serious health complications, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, certain cancers, joint problems, sleep apnea, and mental health issues. Additionally, obesity can have a profound impact on an individual's self-esteem and quality of life, often leading to social stigmatization and discrimination.

Addressing obesity requires a comprehensive approach, including lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, increased physical activity, and, in some cases, medical interventions. Preventive measures, such as promoting healthy eating habits, regular exercise, and awareness campaigns, are crucial in tackling the obesity epidemic and improving public health.

It is essential for individuals to recognize the potential risks of obesity and take proactive steps to maintain a healthy weight to reduce the associated health burdens and improve overall¬†well-being.
