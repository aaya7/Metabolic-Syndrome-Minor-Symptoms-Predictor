st.write("""**ðŸ‘ˆDiabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body processes glucose, a type of sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for your cells. The hormone insulin plays a crucial role in regulating glucose levels in the bloodstream and helps facilitate the entry of glucose into the cells. The persistently high levels of glucose in the blood can lead to various health complications if left uncontrolled. These complications may affect the eyes (diabetic retinopathy), kidneys (diabetic nephropathy), nerves (diabetic neuropathy), and cardiovascular system (increased risk of heart disease and stroke). Proper management of diabetes through medications, insulin therapy, diet, exercise, and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels is essential to prevent or delay complications and maintain overall health and well-being. The symptoms of diabetes can include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and blurred vision. If left unmanaged, diabetes can lead to serious complications, affecting various organs and systems in the body**. 

Long-term high blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels, nerves, and organs like the eyes, kidneys, heart, and feet. This can result in conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (eye damage), diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage), cardiovascular diseases, and diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage). To diagnose diabetes, doctors often perform blood tests to measure fasting blood sugar levels and hemoglobin A1c, which provides an average of blood sugar levels over the past few months. Early detection and proper management are essential to prevent complications and maintain a good quality of life for people with diabetes. Treatment plans may involve lifestyle changes, such as adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise, along with medications to control blood sugar levels. In recent years, advancements in diabetes management have been made, including the development of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, better insulin delivery methods, and improved diabetes education programs. However, diabetes remains a significant public health concern, and efforts to raise awareness, promote healthy lifestyles, and conduct ongoing research are essential in the global fight against this condition.
